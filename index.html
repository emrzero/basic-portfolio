        I don't think much. At least I don't think I do. That's why I like to code. Coding is a way to not think. To mindlessly enter a zone where codified electrical signals are made to represent abstract elements that will then be interpreted by more code and presented on the screen as information. When I'm not coding, I ride my bike. When your leg muscles are burning after 17 miles of riding in LA traffic, you enter a zone where the pedals become your enemy and energy is transferred from your core to the pedals to the gears, and the resulting friction between your tires and the asphalt create forward momentum, it's hard to think about anything other than not eating it on the pavement.

         A little hummingbird visits me every day. It's got a rust-colored chest with emerald-green tail feathers. It sits on the same wire, with the same pose, and the same side to side glances. It promptly leaves after I glance up at it, as if saying "You saw me? Good. Adios!" The moment lasts no more than 10 seconds. It's my favorite part of the day.
